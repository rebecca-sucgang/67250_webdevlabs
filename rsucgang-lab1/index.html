    <p id="intro">I'm a first year student studying Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University, 
        and I'm originally from Laurel, Maryland. My interests lie in the intersection between technology, design, and business, and 
        I'm eager to integrate my technical skills through projects while creating a social impact. I currently work for the Engineering and Public Policy Department 
        at CMU and I analyze data about top engineering and innovation programs, and I was also a case competition finalist for the User Experience Association. 
        Additionally, I run a small business where I design, laser-cut, and sell wooden earrings on Etsy, and I donate a portion of the profits to my local community response fund. 
        I hope to pursue a career in either UX Design, Data Science, or Product Management. </p>
